PROJECT: random alerts for input
  - mvp: alert for input
    - push notification
    - randomly send push notification
  - core feature(s)
    - block off times to not be alerted
    - snooze feature
      - pausing for M minutes
      - no more notifications today
    - de-randomizer: allow specific times to be set for alerts
      - doesn't turn randomizer off

PROJECT: core
  - clear inputs after saving
  - confirmation that it was saved
  - edit past entries
  - delete past entries
  - filter entries
    - filter on disposition
    - tags: location of user (physical placement; e.g., work, school, home)
      - the thinking behind this is that we want an emotion agnostic indicator
        of disposition

PROJECT: self-suggestion feature
  - figure out way to accumulate those suggestions that worked for the user in
    our db, not theirs
      - big idea: we need to create a pool of suggestions to relate to those
        self-suggestions that worked for the user; this is the data we'll use
        with KNN to provide suggestions the user hasn't thought about

PROJECT: ux/ui design decisions
  - come up with design language
    - how are we going to indicate to the user what they should do?
    - how do we reinforce behavior? what behavhior do we want?
    - what queues do we want to use?
      - e.g., first time users for the alerts should see a message
        for what they're about to do
    - standardize action colors and flow
      - e.g., red (or something) for delete-like buttons
        - make opposite of submit
      - flow: where to _always_ place action buttons
